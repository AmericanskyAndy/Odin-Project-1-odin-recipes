        <h1>Leftover Pancake Breakfast Sandwich</h1>

        <p><h3>A great way to use up leftover pancakes! We made this sandwich one weekend purely by accident. It's more of a knife-and-fork breakfast, rather than a eat-with-your-hands sandwich. There's room for lots of variation! I use the Buttermilk Pancakes II recipe for the pancakes.</h3></p>
